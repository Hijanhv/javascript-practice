<!-- what is a callback function? in javascript -->

<!-- A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. -->

<!--javascript isa synchronous & single-threaded language -->

<!-- it means that it can only do one thing at a time.-->
<!-- but it can do things in a non-blocking way. -->
<!-- this is where callback functions come in. -->
<!-- they allow us to perform asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread. -->
<!-- this is useful for tasks like making network requests, reading files, or performing long-running computations. -->
<!-- when we pass a callback function to another function, we are telling that function to call our callback function when it is done with its work. -->
<!-- this allows us to continue executing other code while we wait for the callback function to be called. -->
<!-- this is how we can use callback functions to perform asynchronous operations in JavaScript. -->
<!-- in this example, we have a function called fetchData that simulates an asynchronous operation by using setTimeout. -->
<!-- when the data is ready, it calls the callback function with the data as an argument. -->
<!-- this allows us to handle the data in the callback function without blocking the main thread. -->
