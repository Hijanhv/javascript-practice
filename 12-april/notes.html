    <p>
      the dollar sign is used in many programming languages to denote a
      variable.
      <br />

      //console.log("Final output:" + output); //console.log(`Final output:
      ${output}`); //1. First statement: `"Final output:" + output` // - Uses
      string concatenation with the `+` operator //- This is the older,
      traditional way of combining strings //- Each part is treated separately
      and joined together //- Example: If output is 120, it becomes "Final
      output:" + "120" //2. Second statement: `` `Final output: ${output}` ``
      //- Uses template literals (denoted by backticks `) //- This is the
      modern, ES6+ way of string interpolation //- The `${}` syntax allows you
      to embed expressions directly in the string //- More readable and cleaner
      syntax //- Example: If output is 120, it directly interpolates the value
      //Both produce exactly the same output, but template literals (the second
      one) are: //- More readable //- Less prone to errors //- Easier to
      maintain //- More flexible when dealing with multiple variables //- The
      preferred modern approach in JavaScript //The main difference is just the
      syntax style - the end result is identical.
